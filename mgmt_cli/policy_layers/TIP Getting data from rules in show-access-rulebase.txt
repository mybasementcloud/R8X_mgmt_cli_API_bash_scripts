Subject:	TIP: Getting data from rules in show-access-rulebase

This is more a tip than a question. We fielded a question in a task regarding fetching rule 
content with jq and I felt that I should share the knowledge. 

The problem is that rules are above all section headers (or there are no sections), they are 
accessible with .rulebase[]. On the other hand, rules below section headers are accessible with 
.rulebase[].rulebase[].

How do you have one script that handles both situation, which can even happen in the same 
rulebase?

The answer is to flatten the rulebase and select what you need. 

Here’s an example:
mgmt_cli -r true show-access-rulebase name "$layerName" limit 500 | jq 
-r '. | recurse(.rulebase[]?) | select(.type == "access-rule")'

recurse(.rulebase[]?)  flattens the rulebase to a bunch of rulebase contents: access-rule, 
access-section, place-holder. 
select(.type == "access-rule") filters the access-rules whose data we wish to access.

Hope this helps!
